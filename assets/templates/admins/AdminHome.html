            <p>Traditional ML algorithms encounter great difficulties in processing the huge amount of data generated in smart production  systems. This is due to the fact that they are designed under the assumption that datasets and model parameters must be entirely loaded into the memory. Scalable ML algorithms are a common way to tackle this issue, because they are well suited to handle large datasets and/or models with many parameters.</p>
            <p><strong>Distributed ML algorithms represent the majority of state-ofthe-art scalable ML methods [18]. They can be partitioned into two groups of algorithms that use different parallelism methods: data parallel and model parallel. In the first group, the dataset is divided into smaller pieces, which are stored on nodes in a computer cluster. All parameters of the model will be partially updated concurrently on each node and combined afterward. Conversely, in the second group, the model parameters are divided into subsets and will be updated on each node simultaneously using the whole dataset. There are also some hybrid methods where the dataset, as well as the model parameters, are split and distributed over the cluster.</p>

            <p>the benefits of the proposed big data architecture are shown for a concrete application case with respect to data analytics in industrial environments. Data analytics requires in many cases to learn system models from historic data and to use the learned models for the assessment or processing of current process data.</p>
            <p><strong>An example for such models is the principal component analysis (PCA) matrix, which has versatile industrial applications such as dimensional reduction and condition monitoring approaches (see e.g. [32]â€“[34]). The PCA matrix is computed from historical measurement vectors xk recorded at time instances k = 1 : : : n using a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the covariance matrix.</p>
